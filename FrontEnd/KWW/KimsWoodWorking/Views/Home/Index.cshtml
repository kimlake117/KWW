<h3>Hello and welcome to Kim’s Woodworking!</h3>

<p>The purpose of this site is for me to practice my web development skills. The site takes the form of a fictional 
    wood shop that is looking to sell its products online. Everything on this site is completely fictional. Buying 
    an item won't actually charge your card or facialte a real world order. </p>

<p>
    A random person visiting the site can:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>View the home page</li>
    <li>View products</li>
    <li>Create an account</li>
</ul>

<br />

<p>An authenticated user can do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add a product to their cart</li>
    <li>View their cart</li>
    <li>Delete from their cart</li>
    <li>Edit the quantity of their cart</li>
    <li>Place an order from their cart</li>
    <li>View their previous orders</li>
    <li>Change their password and email</li>
</ul>

<br />

<p>An admin to the site can do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Search all orders</li>
    <li>Edit an order</li>
    <li>Change a users password</li>
    <li>Delete a user account</li>
    <li>Edit a product</li>
</ul>

<br />

<p>Here is an overview of the technologies used in the site.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Front end:  asp.net C# MVC</li>
    <li>Back end : Sqlight3 database</li>
    <li>Hosted on IIS</li>
</ul>

<br />

<p>Site Security:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Checks for cross site scripting</li>
    <li>Uses data validation for user input.</li>
    <li>Parameterized queries using dapper	</li>
    <li>Passwords are encrypted on the client side before being sent to the server.</li>
    <li>If the PW is stored it is hashed with salt.</li>
</ul>

<br />

<p>Areas I know I need to improve in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Graphic design. The site functions right now but could look much better. </li>
</ul>
